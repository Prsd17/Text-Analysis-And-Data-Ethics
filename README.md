### About Datasets
The csv dataset you are provided contains one row per post, and has information about three entities: posts, users and subreddits. The column names are self-explanatory: columns starting with the prefix user_ describe users, those starting with the prefix subr_ describe subreddits, the subreddit column is the subreddit name, and the rest of the columns are post attributes ( author, posted_at, title and post text - the selftext column-, number of comments - num_comments, score, etc.).


### Programming Language
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Datetime, literal_eval, etc.)
